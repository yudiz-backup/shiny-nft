            <li>
              <h4>Risks</h4>
              <p>Please note the following risks in accessing or using everydaygoddesses.io:</p>
              <p>- The price and liquidity of digital assets, including NFTs, are extremely volatile and may be subject to large fluctuations;</p>
              <p>- Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect NFTs, which may also be subject to significant price volatility;</p>
              <p>- Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of NFTs;</p>
              <p>- NFTs are not legal tender and are not backed by the government;</p>
              <p>- Transactions in NFTs may be irreversible, and, accordingly, losses due to fraudulent or accidental transactions may not be recoverable;</p>
              <p>- Some transactions in NFTs shall be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that you initiated the transaction;</p>
              <p>- The value of NFTs may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency or digital assets for NFTs, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular NFT should the market for that NFT disappear;</p>
              <p>- The nature of NFTs may lead to an increased risk of fraud or cyber-attack; Changes to Third Party Sites (discussed in Section 14 below) may create a risk that your access to and use of the Site will suffer.</p>
              <p>You agree and understand that you are solely responsible for determining the nature, potential value, suitability, and appropriateness of these risks for yourself, and that Shiny does not give advice or recommendations regarding NFTs, including the suitability and appropriateness of, and investment strategies for, NFTs. You agree and understand that you access and use Shiny at your own risk; however, this brief statement does not disclose all of the risks associated with NFTs and other digital assets. You agree and understand that Shiny will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using NFTs, however caused.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4> Third Parties</h4>
              <p>Shiny may rely on third-party platforms, including but not limited to MetaMask to perform NFT transactions. Our Site may contain links to third-party websites or applications (collectively, “Third Party Sites”). Shiny does not own or control Third Party Sites. You understand and agree that your use of any Third-Party Site is subject to any terms of use and/or privacy policy provided by such Third-Party Site. Shiny is not a party to any such agreement. You should review any terms of use and/or privacy policy provided by such Third-Party Site and should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party.</p>

Shiny is not responsible for sustained losses due to late reports by developers or representatives (or no report at all) of any issues with the blockchain supporting NFTs including forks, technical node issues or any other issues having fund losses as a result.</p>
              <p>Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude or limit liability of either party for fraud, death or bodily injury caused by negligence, violation of laws, or any other activity that cannot be limited or excluded by legitimate means.</p>
              <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, SHINY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AS TO THE SITE AND CONTENT CONTAINED THEREIN.</p>

            <li>
              <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
              <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SHINY BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, THE SITE, PRODUCTS OR THIRD PARTY SITES AND PRODUCTS, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF SHINY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. ACCESS TO, AND USE OF, THE SITES, PRODUCTS OR THIRD-PARTY SITES AND PRODUCTS ARE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK, AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR COMPUTER SYSTEM OR MOBILE DEVICE OR LOSS OF DATA RESULTING THEREFROM.</p>

THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY OF SHINY FOR (A) DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY A MEMBER OF SHINY’S NEGLIGENCE; OR FOR (B) ANY INJURY CAUSED BY A MEMBER OF SHINY’S FRAUD OR FRAUDULENT MISREPRESENTATION.</p>
              <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury claims.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h4>Indemnification</h4>

              <p>You agree that any dispute or claim relating in any way to: your access, use, or attempted access or use of the Site; any products sold or distributed through the Site; or any aspect of your relationship with Shiny will be resolved by binding arbitration, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or Shiny may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyright, or patent). You agree that any such arbitration shall be settled solely and exclusively by binding arbitration held in Dubai, UAE, conducted in English, rather than in court.</p>
              <p>The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (1) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; and (2) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including but not limited to any claim that all or part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable; (3) decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Shiny; (4) grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim; (5) award monetary damages and grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to a party under applicable law, arbitration rules, and these Terms of Use (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. Such an award is final and binding upon you and us.</p>
              <p>You understand that by agreeing to this Arbitration Agreement, you and Shiny are each waiving their right to trial by jury and to participate in a class action or class arbitration.</p>
