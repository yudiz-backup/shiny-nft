            Tech and art industries have historically been dominated by men, and
            the NFT space is hardly more inclusive - women still make up only
            about 15% of crypto users, while female artists account for a mere
            16% of NFT sales.
          </p>
          <p>Itâ€™s time for this to change.</p>
          <p>
            As we create art and build strong communities, we carve a space of
            our own in the crypto world, allowing for a future of new
            opportunities.

            Everyday Goddesses is a generative project aimed at celebrating
            women in all of their diversity and authenticity. It is your digital
            avatar and membership pass to a community that aims to grow female
            influence in the NFT space, elevate artists, reach new collectors,
            and spread blockchain knowledge.
